UNDERSTANDING

Here's what I understood from your problem:
You need to control a motor using the Sabertooth motor driver based on data received from an RC transmitter. Specifically, you're controlling Motor 1 via the S1 input of the Sabertooth.

The motor control data is being received from an RC transmitter. This transmitter is configured to transmit data within extended limits, which likely means the range of control values is broader than usual.

The data from the RC transmitter is being received by an SBUS receiver module. SBUS is a serial communication protocol that typically sends data for multiple channels in a single data packet.

 The task requires setting up the code to read SBUS data, interpret it, and then send the appropriate signals to the motor driver based on that data.

 
THOUGHT PROCESS

1.Understanding the Components: Sabertooth 2x60 Motor Driver and SBUS Protocol

2.Objective:Convert the SBUS channel value into a format that the Sabertooth motor driver can understand, 
  Ensure that lower SBUS values correspond to reverse motion and higher values correspond to forward motion, with a middle value corresponding to the stop position.
  
3.Mapping SBUS to Sabertooth Command

4.Serial Communication: Set up serial communication to send the calculated command to the Sabertooth motor driver.

5.Code Implementation:(CODE) Ensure that the SBUS data is correctly received and decoded.
  Apply the mapping function to convert the SBUS channel value to the Sabertooth command range.
  Send the command via serial to the motor driver.
  
6.Testing and Fine-Tuning: After implementing the code, test it to verify that the rover moves correctly in response to the RC transmitter.
